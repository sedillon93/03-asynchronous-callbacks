The program contains one function: readFile. The function takes two parameters. The first parameter must be an array of absolute file paths. The second parameter must be a callback function. If a non-array is provided as the first parameter an error is thrown. If a non-function is provided as the second parameter an error is thrown. If no errors are present readFile returns an array containing the first 64 characters of each file provided in an array in the order in which the files were in the array.
